### Minor Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/pull/206) [`a7a3315`](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/commit/a7a3315471b58b65cdd4e82dec7f85006d3baf1c) Thanks [@mayakoneval](https://github.com/mayakoneval)! - _New features!!_: Now users have the ability to set the initial autopoll state, set whether or not your sandbox endpoint is editable, be able to embed an Apollo operation collection, and set sharedHeaders in Sandbox for all folks using your embed.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/pull/215) [`e542db7`](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/commit/e542db737e8d66aa25f3fb971f10f3437a8c4037) Thanks [@esilverm](https://github.com/esilverm)! - This major release affects how we send cookies to your embedded Sandbox and embedded Explorer. Previously, when a user passed the `includeCookies` config option we would set cookies on the default `fetch` request. However, when working in Sandbox or Explorer in Studio we let users set `includeCookies` in their connection settings. This change deprecates the old `includeCookies` option and passes the `includeCookies` value set in Explorer to your embedded Explorer or embedded Sandbox. In embedded Sandbox, you can configure whether cookies are initially on or off for your users on first load with the new config option `initialState.includeCookies`. You can decide to show or hide the connection settings toggle for your users with the config option `hideCookieToggle`. This change is backwards compatible, so if you are using the deprecated `includeCookies` config option, that overrides all other config options & your Studio settings.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#177](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/pull/177) [`bcff038`](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/commit/bcff038e9fbfffd0b215c94fefff319646114a85) Thanks [@bigman73](https://github.com/bigman73)! - This major release makes a small change to default functionality of the `includeCookies` configuration option for the embedded Sandbox & the embedded Explorer. Previously, when a user passed `includeCookies: false` or omitted this option, we would make fetch requests with `{ credentials: same-origin }`. However, embedded Sandbox often runs on the same origin as the endpoint users are fetching against, so cookies would still be included. This change passes `{ credentials: omit }` instead of `{ credentials: same-origin }` in the default & false case. No change to the `includeCookies: true` case.
